    <h1>Game Description</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Wordle is a web-based word game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. The mechanics are nearly identical to the 1955 pen-and-paper game Jotto and the television game show franchise Lingo. Wordle has a single daily solution, with all players attempting to guess the same word.</p>

    <p>Wordle created the game to play with his partner, eventually making it public in October 2021. The game gained popularity in December 2021 after Wordle added the ability for players to copy their daily results as emoji squares, which were widely shared on Twitter. Many clones and variations of the game were also created, as were versions in languages besides English. The game was purchased by The New York Times Company in January 2022 for an undisclosed seven-figure sum; the game was moved to the Times website in February 2022 and remains free for all players.</p>

    <p>Placele is our spinoff of this concept, you will be shown an image of the place in question and be given a limited amount of attempts at guessing said place. This place may be a country, state, or even a city, and like Wordle, characters will be highlighted certain colors to help the user find the answer.</p>
